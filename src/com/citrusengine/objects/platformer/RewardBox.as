	 * The RewardBox is a special type of platform that you can "bump" to make a reward come out. It is meant to be similar
	 * to those "question blocks" or "mystery blocks" in mario.
	 * 
	 * Params: 
	 * - You can set the <code>rewardClass</code> value to specify what kind of reward to have the box create. The reward class object
	 * that is generated must extend the "Reward" class.
	 * 
	 * This means that you must also create a class that extends <code>Reward<code> for every reward type that you want in your game.
	 * If you were making a mario clone, you would make a FireFlowerReward. This is where you would specify the reward's graphics,
	 * its initial impulse out of the box, and any custom code such as unique movement or a death timer.
	 * 
	 * - You can specify the "collision normal" angle that you must come at it in order for it to generate a reward. The default is 90,
	 * which is "from below", as long as the box is not rotated.
	 * 
	 * Animations:
	 * Your Reward box should have a "normal" and "used" animation state. Once the box's reward has been obtained, it cannot be used again.
	 * 
	 * Events:
	 * The RewardBox has two Signals. The first event is <code>onUse</code>, which gets dispatched when the reward box gets bumped.
	 * It passes a reference of itself.
	 * 
	 * The Second event is <code>onRewardCollect</code>, which gets dispatched when the reward is collected. This is where you would
	 * write the code to grant your player the reward (such as a greater jump height, more points, or another life).
	 * 
	 * Other: 
	 * If you don't want the reward box to generate a reward, (or you want the reward to be granted immediately, like points),
	 * you can set the rewardClass to null and just listen for the "onUse" event to grant the player the reward.
